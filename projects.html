Project Ideas
============================================================== 

- Extend our verifier with pointers and prove the correctness of a pointer manipulating program (say, a linked-list implementation).
- Extend our verifier with Bitvector types. Implement a crypto-algorithm (AES, SHA) and prove its correctness.
- Build a larger verified application with our verifier and add a runtime with webassembly (you can use [this](https://www.wasm.builders/gunjan_0307/compiling-javascript-to-wasm-34lk) as a starting point).
- Add automation to our verifier by implementing [this paper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~cormac/papers/fme01.pdf). This is an easier algorithm than the one discussed in class.
- Implement IFC type system for nano, and write a secure application. 
- Implement a program synthesis tool. Take a look at [this blog post](https://barghouthi.github.io/2017/04/24/synthesis-primer/) to get you started. Can you think of a class of programs where sythesis is particularly useful?
- Add Horn clause inference via predicate abstraction to the verifier, as discussed in class.
- Implement this [type system](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/ccured_toplas.pdf) for memory safety.
- Implement a different type system for memory safety: see [this](https://borretti.me/article/type-systems-memory-safety) for inspiration.
- Extend our verifier to make it more usable. Whenever Z3 produces a counterexample use [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) to test if the counterexample is reachable. If yes, the program is incorrect. Else, the invariant has to be refined.
- Add a “decreases” annotation to the verifier, like in [Dafny](http://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-decreases-clause). This can be used to prove termination. Use can use [this](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/Patrick_Gruntz_BA_report.pdf) as starting point.
- Implement this optimized [verification condition generation algorithm](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~cormac/papers/popl01.pdf).
- Build a VCGen based verifier for LLVM IR, e.g., using [this library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-hs).
- Reimplement [this paper](https://files.sri.inf.ethz.ch/website/papers/sigcomm20-netdice.pdf) for probabilistic network verification.
- Reimplement [this paper](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/papers/minesweeper-sigcomm17.pdf) for SMT based network verification.
- Reimplement [this algorithm](https://theory.stanford.edu/~arbrad/papers/Understanding_IC3.pdf) for checking program correctness automatically. Can you use it to verify an interesting program?
- Add a more advanced memory model to our verifier. To start, take a look at [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-93900-9_24) or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00053.pdf).

- Implement [liquid types checking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07763.pdf).
- We can use arrays to reason about concurrent programs that are run with arbitrary many threads. Each array element is used to encode the local state of one of the threads. See e.g., [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3009837.3009893). Implement and verify a challenging concurrent algorithm.
